If you are getting the 0770 error and are on an exfat drive
```
'check_data_directory_permissions' => false,
```

If you are having the login screen hanging add this code to the config file as well. it has to do with "https" add it right after ""'overwrite.cli.url' => 'http://localhost',""
```
'overwriteprotocol' => 'https',
```
